# Java Template

This project loads several libraries that will help keep an enterprise Java application healthy.
Some are easier to get right from the beginning.

Technology | Explanation
---------- | --------
Maven      | Still the standard, with simple multi-module build
Dagger     | Dependency injection at compile time is best.
Autovalue  | Simple boilerplate reduction for immutable value objects
Mapstruct  | Boilerplate reduction for mapping similar objects
Log4j2     | The best performing logging framework
Mx4j       | Control your app remotely
Errorprone | Catch a lot of bugs at compile time
Nullaway   | Avoid NullPointerExceptions, at compile time
Checkstyle | Enforce standard code formatting, at compile time

## Instructions

Substitute "javatemplate" with your application name, and "com.bavelsoft" with your company path. You might want to rename the hellofeature directory and its contents. Entirely replace this file.

## TODO

* actually use mx4j
* schmoperties after deploying to mavencentral
* nullaway for protobuf3
* simple deploy?
